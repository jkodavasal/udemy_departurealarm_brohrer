# udemy_departurealarm_brohrer
Personal repository of material related to the Udemy course End-to-end ML with decision trees by Brandon Rohrer
This folder contains a description (as a pdf file) of a bug in the program which is not fatal, but will lead to incorrect results. This pdf also describes the solution to fix this bug.
It also contains two smaller versions of the course's code to illustrate this issue and demonstrate the fix -- one with the bug (departure_alarm_debug.py) and the other with the bug fixed (departure_alarm_debug_fixed.py)
